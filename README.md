# Open Organelle Test Project

This is a test project to show [MoBIE](https://github.com/mobie/mobie-viewer-fiji)'s capabilities to open data from the Open Organelle data repository.
It uses the `jrc_hela-2` cell and contains the raw dta and the endosome segmentation.
For more informations on this data and openOrganelle in general, check out https://openorganelle.janelia.org/.
